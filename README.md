# DESCRIPTION
  Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a fascinating deep learning technique that merges two images—one containing artistic style and the other containing content—to create a new image that mimics the style of the first while preserving the structure of the second. It’s an application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and is widely used for creative AI-driven art generation.
